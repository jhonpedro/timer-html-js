## Timer with HTML and JS

This is a simple project but we have some cool concepts here like IIFE, using querySelectors, 'use strict', eventListeners, and some other things...

I plan add a "jump" field in my vars to set how much i have to add in my seconds (right now is 1, so my "jump" is 1 for each 1000ms).

You can see it online [here](https://jhonpedro.github.io/timer-html-js/index.html)
